- 👋 Hi, I’m @cemileblks
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of bioinformatics, genomics, and software development to solve real-world biomedical problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bioinformatics and building a foundation in computational biology as an MSc student.
- 💻 Previously, I worked on front-end web development projects, mainly using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Check out my pinned projects).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bioinformatics projects: in genomics, proteomics, or applications of AI in healthcare.
